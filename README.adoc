= TODO =

* selinux.macros: use semanage with -S <store>
* Do not use `semanage import` - it doesn't set boolean in a system, but only on a filesystem

= Tests =

    $ sudo install beakerlib

    $ sudo ./runtest.sh

= DONE =

* selinux.macros: store current value to %{_file_custom_defined_booleans}
* selinux.macros: use value from %{_file_custom_defined_booleans} and set it via semanage (import|boolean)
* prepare a basic testsuite with these situations
** install/uninstall package
*** with a boolean not modified before
*** with a boolean modified before
*** with a boolean modified before but twice - to a default value 
** install/uninstall multiple packages
*** with a boolean not modified before
*** with a boolean modified before
*** with a boolean modified before but twice - to a default value
